## Overview

**Colossus.Ai** is a **Roadmap Visualization Tool** that serves as a comprehensive **Learning Guide System**. It
processes **documentation materials** to generate a **Visualization Knowledge Graph** , which delivers
accurate and relevant information based on user queries.
This application addresses the growing complexity of accessing structured information in fields like
education and other domains. By simplifying the retrieval of relevant information, it empowers users to
navigate complex documentation in an easier and more convenient manner.
The primary purpose of the **Knowledge Graph System** is to simplify the process of extracting useful
insights from complex and structured materials. The tool achieves this by presenting the information as
a visual roadmap, making it intuitive and accessible to users.
**Key Objectives** :

1. **Relevance** : Ensuring that the generated information aligns closely with user queries.
2. **Simplicity and Intuitiveness** : Offering an easy-to-use and visually appealing user interface.
3. **Accuracy** : Maintaining high standards of precision in the generated knowledge graph.


### Problem

The growing integration of AI tools in education has brought about significant challenges in ensuring
the accuracy, clarity, and accessibility of information. Current AI-powered educational resources often
struggle to deliver reliable and understandable assistance, leaving users—students, educators, and
professionals—unsatisfied with the quality of their learning experience.
Research highlights several key issues: the rapid adoption of AI tools like ChatGPT has led to concerns
about academic integrity, with educators questioning whether such platforms encourage plagiarism or
hinder genuine learning. Moreover, students frequently find themselves double-checking AI-generated
content for relevance and clarity, as current systems often fail to provide sufficient depth or structure
in their responses. The algorithms driving these platforms can also unintentionally amplify errors or
create misleading assumptions, further diminishing trust in AI's ability to enhance learning.
This gap in the current educational landscape highlights a pressing need for a system that goes beyond
conventional AI tools. Users demand a platform that not only ensures content accuracy but also
organizes and presents complex information in an intuitive and user-friendly way. Without such
advancements, the potential of AI to revolutionize education remains untapped, leaving customers
with limited solutions for navigating and understanding dense or intricate documentation.

### Objectives

1. Delivering intuitive user friendly UI (User Interface)
2. Delivering a seamless and satisfying user experience
3. Delivering the ability to enter queries
4. Delivering the ability to attach files to the system
5. Generating Knowledge Graphs according to the user queries

### Constraints

1. Time constraints that will limit the project to the Academic domain
2. Engineering constraints that will limit the ability to generate large-scale Knowledge Graphs in a
    single session.

#### 3. Constraint 3

12. Share Graph session

### User Stories

1. User Account
    a. As a user, I want to create an account so that I can use all the features.
    b. As a user, I want to log in to the account I created so that I can use the system without
       limitations.
    c. As a user, I want to be able to log in with multiple accounts so that I can use the system
       with various accounts.
2. Document Management
    a. As a user, I want to add documents to the system so that I can start generating
       Knowledge Graphs.
    b. As a user, I want to be able to create directories/domains for different types of content,
       that I want to work with so that I can organize content and choose what domain I want
       to interact with.
    c. As a user, I want to search inserted documents so that I can choose what documents to
       generate graphs or read the content.
    d. As a user, I want to browse and view documents so that I can read the contents of them
       when I need.


(^) e. As a user, I want to be able to remove added documents so that I can have only the
useful documents in the directory/domain.

3. Querying
    a. As a user, I want to enter a query into the system so that I can define what I want the
       system to do.
    b. As a user, I want to enter my natural language interpretation as the query to the system
       so that I can express what I want without hesitation.
    c. As a user, I want to define the scale/start and end points of the knowledge graph so that
       I can get the intended information with ease.
4. Knowledge Graph Generation and Interaction
    a. As a user, I want to be able to generate a Knowledge Graph with an entered query using
       the inserted documentation so that I can fulfil my intention.
    b. As a user, I want to be able to tap and expand generated graph nodes so that I can view
       the information of the specific node.
    c. As a user, I want to change the location of the nodes as I please so that I can place nodes
       in places that I see fit better.
    d. As a user, I want to see the connections between nodes so that I can understand the
       flow of the graph.
    e. As a user, I want to be able to access previously generated knowledge Graphs so that I
       can view them whenever I want without generating them again.
    f. As a user, I want to share my generated graphs with other users so that they can view
       knowledge graphs without needing the documentation.
5. Summary Generation and interaction
    a. As a user, i want to generate a summary of specified documentation so that I can get an
       understanding of what the documentation is about.
    b. As a user, I want to be able to search and access previously generated summaries so
       that I can view them without developing them again.
