# ColossusAI Document Analysis Application - Backend Development Guide

## Overview
I'm developing a document analysis and visualization application with a React frontend and need to create backend APIs to support the chat interface, document processing, and visualization features. The frontend is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and various UI components.

## Chat Page Structure
The main chat page (`app/chatpage/page.tsx`) consists of three primary panels:

1. **Chatbot Panel**:
   - Chat message list displaying user and assistant messages
   - Input form with text input and file upload capability
   - Message history state management

2. **Graph Visualization Panel**:
   - Force-directed graph using amCharts 5
   - Network visualization of document connections
   - Zoom controls and view toggles (Network/Timeline)
   - Category and keyword label toggles

3. **Document Viewer Panel**:
   - Document viewer for uploaded files
   - Page navigation controls
   - Placeholder for rendering document pages

## Key Components and State

### Message Handling
```typescript
// State for chat messages
const [messages, setMessages] = useState<{role: 'user' | 'assistant', content: string}[]>([
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hello! I can help you analyze your documents. Upload a file or ask me a question.' }
]);

// State for user input
const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState('');
```

### File Upload
```typescript
// State for file upload
const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState<File | null>(null);

// Handle file selection
const handleFileChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  if (e.target.files && e.target.files[0]) {
    setSelectedFile(e.target.files[0]);
  }
};
```

### Document Viewer
```typescript
// State for document viewer
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(0);
const [pdfPages, setPdfPages] = useState(samplePdfPages);
```

### Graph Visualization
```typescript
// Reference to the graph component
const graphRef = useRef<GraphRef>(null);

// Graph data structure (from ForceDirectedGraph.tsx)
const data = {
  name: "Documents",
  value: 0,
  children: [
    {
      name: "Financial Report 2023",
      value: 1,
      children: [
        { name: "Q1 Analysis", value: 1 },
        { name: "Q2 Analysis", value: 1 },
        { name: "Annual Forecast", value: 1 }
      ]
    },
    // ...more document clusters
  ]
};
```

## Required Backend APIs

Please develop the following backend APIs to support this frontend:

1. **Chat API**:
   - Message handling endpoint that processes user queries about documents
   - Support for context-aware conversations about uploaded documents
   - Integration with LLM for generating responses
   - Ability to reference specific parts of documents in responses

2. **Document Processing API**:
   - File upload endpoint for documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
   - Document parsing and text extraction
   - Document metadata extraction (title, author, date, etc.)
   - Content analysis for entity extraction, topic modeling, and keyword identification

3. **Graph Data API**:
   - Generate document relationship data for visualization
   - Support for different relationship types (similar content, shared topics, etc.)
   - Filtering capabilities for the graph data
   - Timeline view generation based on document dates

4. **Document Rendering API**:
   - Convert document pages to viewable format
   - Page navigation support
   - Text highlighting capabilities
   - Support for annotations and comments

## Technical Requirements

- RESTful API design
- Authentication and authorization
- Efficient document storage and retrieval
- Real-time or near-real-time processing
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting and security considerations

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Document Storage**:
   - How will documents be stored? (File system, object storage, database)
   - How will document metadata be stored and indexed?
   - How will document content be made searchable?

2. **Text Analysis**:
   - What NLP techniques will be used for document analysis?
   - How will document relationships be determined?
   - How will document topics and keywords be extracted?

3. **Chat Context Management**:
   - How will conversation context be maintained?
   - How will document references be tracked in conversations?
   - How will the LLM be prompted to provide relevant document insights?

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - How will document processing be optimized for large files?
   - How will graph visualization data be optimized for complex document relationships?
   - How will API responses be cached for improved performance?

Please provide implementation details, data models, and API specifications that will integrate seamlessly with the existing frontend components.
